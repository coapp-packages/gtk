>"The reason buttons don't move their child down and to
the right when they are depressed is because I don't think
that's what is happening visually. My view of buttons is
that you are looking at them straight on. That is, the user
interface lies in a plane and you're above it looking
straight at it. When a button gets pressed it moves directly
away from you. To be absolutely correct I guess the child
should actually shrink a tiny amount. But I don't see why
the child should shift down and to the left. Remember, the
child is supposed to be attached to the buttons surface. Its
not good for it to appear like the child is slipping on the
surface of the button."</SPAN
