>GTK (GIMP Toolkit) is a library for creating graphical user
interfaces. It is licensed using the LGPL license, so you can develop
open software, free software, or even commercial non-free software
using GTK without having to spend anything for licenses or royalties.</P
><P
>It's called the GIMP toolkit because it was originally written for
developing the GNU Image Manipulation Program (GIMP), but GTK has
now been used in a large number of software projects, including the
GNU Network Object Model Environment (GNOME) project. GTK is built on
top of GDK (GIMP Drawing Kit) which is basically a wrapper around the
low-level functions for accessing the underlying windowing functions
(Xlib in the case of the X windows system), and gdk-pixbuf, a library for
client-side image manipulation.</P
><P
>GTK is essentially an object oriented application programmers
interface (API). Although written completely in C, it is implemented
using the idea of classes and callback functions (pointers to
functions).</P
><P
>There is also a third component called GLib which contains a few
replacements for some standard calls, as well as some additional
functions for handling linked lists, etc. The replacement functions
are used to increase GTK's portability, as some of the functions
implemented here are not available or are nonstandard on other Unixes
such as g_strerror(). Some also contain enhancements to the libc
versions, such as g_malloc() that has enhanced debugging utilities.</P
><P
>In version 2.0, GLib has picked up the type system which forms the
foundation for GTK's class hierarchy, the signal system which is used
throughout GTK, a thread API which abstracts the different native thread APIs 
of the various platforms and a facility for loading modules.</P
><P
>As the last component, GTK uses the Pango library for internationalized
text output.</P
><P
>This tutorial describes the C interface to GTK. There are GTK
bindings for many other languages including C++, Guile, Perl, Python,
TOM, Ada95, Objective C, Free Pascal, Eiffel, Java and C#. If you intend to
use another language's bindings to GTK, look at that binding's
documentation first. In some cases that documentation may describe
some important conventions (which you should know first) and then
refer you back to this tutorial. There are also some cross-platform
APIs (such as wxWindows and V) which use GTK as one of their target
platforms; again, consult their documentation first.</P
><P
>If you're developing your GTK application in C++, a few extra notes
are in order. There's a C++ binding to GTK called GTK--, which
provides a more C++-like interface to GTK; you should probably look
into this instead. If you don't like that approach for whatever
reason, there are two alternatives for using GTK. First, you can use
only the C subset of C++ when interfacing with GTK and then use the C
interface as described in this tutorial. Second, you can use GTK and
C++ together by declaring all callbacks as static functions in C++
classes, and again calling GTK using its C interface. If you choose
this last approach, you can include as the callback's data value a
pointer to the object to be manipulated (the so-called "this" value).
Selecting between these options is simply a matter of preference,
since in all three approaches you get C++ and GTK. None of these
approaches requires the use of a specialized preprocessor, so no
matter what you choose you can use standard C++ with GTK.</P
><P
>This tutorial is an attempt to document as much as possible of GTK,
but it is by no means complete. This tutorial assumes a good
understanding of C, and how to create C programs. It would be a great
benefit for the reader to have previous X programming experience, but
it shouldn't be necessary. If you are learning GTK as your first
widget set, please comment on how you found this tutorial, and what
you had trouble with. There are also C++, Objective C, ADA, Guile and
other language bindings available, but I don't follow these.</P
