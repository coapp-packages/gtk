> Drag action type (ie GDK_ACTION_COPY, GDK_ACTION_MOVE).</P
></LI
><LI

> Client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type (a name and number pair).</P

>Drag actions are quite obvious, they specify if the widget can
drag with the specified action(s), e.g. GDK_ACTION_COPY and/or
GDK_ACTION_MOVE. A GDK_ACTION_COPY would be a typical drag-and-drop
without the source data being deleted while GDK_ACTION_MOVE would be
just like GDK_ACTION_COPY but the source data will be 'suggested' to be
deleted after the received signal handler is called. There are
additional drag actions including GDK_ACTION_LINK which you may want to
look into when you get to more advanced levels of drag-and-drop.</P
><P
>The client specified arbitrary drag-and-drop type is much more
flexible, because your application will be defining and checking for
that specifically. You will need to set up your destination widgets to
receive certain drag-and-drop types by specifying a name and/or number.
It would be more reliable to use a name since another application may
just happen to use the same number for an entirely different
meaning.</P
><P
>Sent and received data format types (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>selection
target</I
>) come into play only in your request and received
data handler functions. The term <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>selection target</I
>
is somewhat misleading. It is a term adapted from GTK+ selection
(cut/copy and paste). What <I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>selection target</I
>
actually means is the data's format type (i.e. GdkAtom, integer, or
string) that being sent or received. Your request data handler function
needs to specify the type (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>selection target</I
>) of
data that it sends out and your received data handler needs to handle
the type (<I
CLASS="EMPHASIS"
>selection target</I
>) of data
received.</P
