call our "destroy" signal handler.</P

>We are also going to use this button to exit our program. This will
illustrate how the "destroy" signal may come from either the window
manager, or our program. When the button is "clicked", same as above,
it calls the first hello() callback function, and then this one in the
order they are set up. You may have as many callback functions as you
need, and all will be executed in the order you connected
them. Because the gtk_widget_destroy() function accepts only a
GtkWidget *widget as an argument, we use the g_signal_connect_swapped() 
function here instead of straight g_signal_connect().</P

>This is a packing call, which will be explained in depth later on in
<A
HREF="c354.html"
>Packing Widgets</A
>. But it is
fairly easy to understand. It simply tells GTK that the button is to
be placed in the window where it will be displayed. Note that a GTK
container can only contain one widget. There are other widgets, that
are described later, which are designed to layout multiple widgets in
various ways.

signal handlers in place, and the button placed in the window where it
should be, we ask GTK to "show" the widgets on the screen. The window
widget is shown last so the whole window will pop up at once rather
than seeing the window pop up, and then the button form inside of
it. Although with such a simple example, you'd never notice.</P

><P
>Now, when we click the mouse button on a GTK button, the widget emits
a "clicked" signal. In order for us to use this information, our
program sets up a signal handler to catch that signal, which
dispatches the function of our choice. In our example, when the button
we created is "clicked", the hello() function is called with a NULL
argument, and then the next handler for this signal is called. This
calls the gtk_widget_destroy() function, passing it the window widget
as its argument, destroying the window widget. This causes the window
to emit the "destroy" signal, which is caught, and calls our destroy()
callback function, which simply exits GTK.</P
><P
>Another course of events is to use the window manager to kill the
window, which will cause the "delete-event" to be emitted. This will
call our "delete-event" handler. If we return TRUE here, the window
will be left as is and nothing will happen. Returning FALSE will cause
GTK to emit the "destroy" signal which of course calls the "destroy"
callback, exiting GTK.</P
